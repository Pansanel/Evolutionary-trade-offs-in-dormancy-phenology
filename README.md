# Dormancy Analysis (dorman)

This repository hosts code and data files for replicating all statistical
results reported in the article written by Constant *et al.*:
"Evolutionary trade-offs in dormancy phenology".

The preprint is available on-line:

## Running the analysis

The code will run most efficiently if all files are saved to a common
directory.
